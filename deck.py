Programming Project 4--Deck class

The Deck class represents a stadard deck of playing cards with or without two jokers.
The card files for the graphic of each card are in a folder named cards. Each card
file is named with its rank and a letter for its suit. For example, the 4 of hearts
is in the file 4h.gif while the jack of clubs is in the file 11c.gif.
